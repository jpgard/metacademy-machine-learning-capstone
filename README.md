# Metacademy Machine Learning Capstone

This is a series of machine learning projects recommended and developed by the founder of metacademy, Colorado Read. The series was developed as a sequence of projects designed to provide opportunities to apply and experiment with methods for machine learning. I extend his recommendations here, and implement the projects in both R and Python in order to experiment with several different approaches and toolsets for machine learning. The full posting introducing the series and providing suggested readings alongside the projects is here: https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/cjrd/level-up-your-ml

##Projects:

###Level 0:

"Using the UCI Auto dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG) see if you can predict the MPG of the car given all of its other attributes. This will test your ability to manipulate data for a desired machine learning task, and also your ability to apply the correct machine learning technique to a somewhat vague problem."
